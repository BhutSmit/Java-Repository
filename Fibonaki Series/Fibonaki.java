/*

Fibonaki Series Is Reprent Like This...

 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 ....... 


 So Here As Per Program a = 0 And b = 1 ;

 ðŸ‘‰  In a Fibbonaki Series a Next Number Is Come With Addition Of Two Number Which Stand Before New NUmber

 ðŸ‘‰  in a fibbo series first two step are fixed so we print this step as it is

 ðŸ‘‰   a = 0  b = 1

 	   In For Loop....

 	   fibbo = a + b    =  0 + 1 = 1 

 	   a = b     		=  1

 	   b = fibbo		=  1

 	   print(b)


 	 ---> Execute Loop Second Time.
 	 

	     fibbo = a + b    =  1 + 1  = 2

 		 a = b     		  =  1 

 	     b = fibbo		  =  2

 	  	 print(b)


âœ”  With The Help Of This Progrm We Can Print Fibonaki Series Very Easily.
